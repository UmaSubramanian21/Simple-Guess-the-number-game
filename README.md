# Simple-Guess-the-number-game
 I just created a simple "Guess the Random Number" game using HTML5, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS! It’s a fun little project where players guess a number between 1 and 5.
This project helped me practice JavaScript logic and experiment with Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive styling. The challenge of combining functionality with a visually appealing design was incredibly rewarding.
